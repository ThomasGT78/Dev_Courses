			/** VUE.js INTRODUCTION **/

Import Vue by adding a <script> tag inside the <head> of your projectâ€™s HTML file:
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js" defer></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js" defer></script>

/* 
defer :
Attribute on the <script> tag to make sure that the page is loaded and ready to hook up to Vue before we actually load Vue 
*/

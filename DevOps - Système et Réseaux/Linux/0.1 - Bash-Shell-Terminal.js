	/**  BASH / SHELL / TERMINAL  **/

`The terms bash, shell, and terminal are related to each other and often used interchangeably, but they refer to different aspects of the command-line environment in a Unix-like operating system. Here's a breakdown of their meanings`

// Shell 
`In the context of Unix-like operating systems, a shell is a program that provides an interface for users to interact with the operating system. It interprets and executes commands entered by the user and acts as a command-line interpreter. The shell processes commands, manages inputoutput, runs programs, and provides various features like scripting capabilities, environment variables, and command history. Examples of shells include Bash (Bourne Again Shell), Zsh (Z Shell), and Ksh (Korn Shell).`

// Bash 
`Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is one of the most commonly used shells in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and macOS. It is a popular replacement for the original Bourne shell (sh) and provides enhancements and additional features. Bash is backward-compatible with sh and also includes advanced functionality such as command-line editing, job control, shell scripting capabilities, and support for a wide range of utilities and tools.`

// Terminal 
`A terminal refers to the graphical or text-based interface that allows users to interact with the operating system through a command-line environment. It provides a window or console where you can enter commands and see their output. A terminal emulates the functionality of an older hardware device called a terminal, which was used to communicate with the computer. In modern systems, a terminal can be a graphical application (e.g., GNOME Terminal, macOS Terminal) or a text-based interface accessed via a virtual console or terminal emulator.

To summarize, the shell is the program that interprets and executes commands, such as Bash. The terminal is the interface (either graphical or text-based) that allows users to interact with the shell and enter commands. Bash is a specific shell, known for its popularity and extensive features, but there are other shells available as well.
